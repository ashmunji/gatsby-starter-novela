## The Illustration

As a child <strike>even now</strike>, I was always obsessed with the sublime beauty of the night, trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe in my little head.   
This Illustration is a small fragment of my imagination, hoping to hold the stars in my hand one day. :)

<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/Device.jpg"
    title="Logo Title Text 1"
    alt="Alt text"
  />
</div>
