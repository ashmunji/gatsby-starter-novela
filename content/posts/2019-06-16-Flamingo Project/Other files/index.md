## The Project

This was mainly an exercise to understand and explore the different techniques of image-making. Various techniques led to various results and each result was unique in terms of the materials used, the message it conveyed and differed in the complexity of the subject.  
   
While conducting research for this project, I found [Flamingos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamingo), to be a very interesting bird species and perfect as my subject to make art explorations.  
I mean who wouldn't admire their vibrant, pastel coats? Aren't those long necks and tall legs absolutely to die for?
